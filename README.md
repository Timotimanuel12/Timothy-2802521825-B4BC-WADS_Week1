_(Note: You can change this to any topic listed in the prompt like Git, Node.js, etc.)_

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.

### Key Features

1. **Virtual DOM:** React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.
2. **JSX:** A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code. okok
